# Magento 2 Admin Email Notifications Extension

Stay on top of critical errors and system events with the [Magento 2 Admin Email Notifications Extension](https://plumrocket.com/magento-admin-email-notifications) . This powerful tool helps store administrators monitor site health by providing real-time email alerts and an intuitive error log dashboard directly in the Magento admin panel. Prevent costly downtime, speed up issue resolution, and ensure your store runs smoothly—without ever having to dig through server files manually.

## Key Features

### Easily Monitor Magento Error Logs  
Gain visibility into your store’s technical health with a clear, admin-friendly error log table. View a detailed log of all alerts, including Critical, Error, Warning, Info, and other types, organized by severity, date, location file, and message.

### Schedule Email Notifications  
Set up automated alerts so that Magento 2 store admins receive email notifications when new errors are logged. Customize the frequency of log checks and notifications—every 30 minutes, hourly, or daily—and send alerts to one or multiple recipients for fast issue awareness.

### Get Only the Most Relevant Notifications  
Focus on what matters. Choose to receive alerts only for critical issues affecting store functionality and sales, or enable broader event tracking to stay informed of all system activities. Customize alerts by severity level to match your priorities.

### Enjoy Quick Log Access & Easy Filtering  
No need to shift through server files. Quickly locate logs from the Magento 2 admin panel using advanced filters by type (critical, emergency, notice, etc.), date, file, and message content. Expand individual entries for full details or delete resolved logs to maintain clarity.

### Keep Your Logs Clean and Up-to-Date  
Maintain a streamlined admin interface with automated log cleanup. Define how long logs should be retained and set automatic deletion intervals. Keep your monitoring setup efficient and clutter-free with scheduled system checks as often as every 30 minutes.
